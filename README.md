# BlockRoll: Decentralized Gambling Platform

BlockRoll is a blockchain-based gambling platform that offers users the chance to play fun and fair betting games, including a Coin Flip, Dice Roll, and Event-based Betting (such as betting on the outcome of live sports events). Built with a focus on transparency and security, BlockRoll leverages the power of blockchain to ensure that all games and transactions are trustless and tamper-proof.

### Features:
- Blockchain-based Fairness: BlockRoll uses smart contracts written in Solidity to handle all bets, payouts, and game outcomes, ensuring a transparent process for all players.
- Decentralized Randomness: Games like Coin Flip and Dice Roll use Chainlink's VRF2.5 to generate random numbers, providing provably fair results for each round.
- Event-based Betting: Real-time betting odds are fetched using the Odds-API, allowing users to place bets on live events (e.g., sports) with accurate data.
- Secure Payments: All payouts are directly sent to users' crypto wallets, ensuring fast, secure, and transparent transactions.

### Tech Stack:
- Solidity: Smart contract development
- Remix IDE: Smart contract deployment and testing
- Truffle & Ganache: Local development and testing
- Sepolia Testnet: Smart contract deployment
- Web3.js & React.js: Frontend integration

BlockRoll brings a new level of trust and excitement to online gambling by utilizing blockchain technology. Play, bet, and win â€“ all while enjoying the transparency and security of decentralized applications.
